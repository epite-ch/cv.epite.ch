Looking for a new developer?


About
=====

{Slaves of Epite.ch} came to life after a lot of friends running startups asked me the same question: "How can I hire one of your {Epitech} dev friends?". They were posting their (genuinely attractive) job offers all over the internet and yet, they couldn't get in touch with their dream developer...

Answering this issue was the basis for {Slaves of Epite.ch}: students from {Epitech} looking for a job would be able to quickly make a simple profile page and startups looking for a developer would just have to look through the profiles in search of their future employee and easily take a look at their GitHub, contact them,...


Technologies
============

Some Node.js, some MongoDb, some ejs and some Bootstrap :)
